Code Repo for my Caribbean Developer Week presentation on Phaser 3

## Presentation

(Minimal) Open Document Presentation file is also in the repo.


## Play
You can play the game on http://msanatan.com/red-vs-blue/


## What do to do next?
Well you noticed that the shootLaser is generic right? Complete the game by allow enemies to shoot at you. If your ship gets hit then you get a "Game Over" message on the screen
